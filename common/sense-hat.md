Sense HAT
=========

What is Sense HAT?
------------------
> The Sense HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi, made espacially for the [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org/) mission to go in Space.
> The Sense HAT has an 8x8 RGB LED matrix, a five-button joystick and includes the following sensors:
    
>    - Gyroscope
>    - Accelerometer
>    - Magnetometer
>    - Barometric pressure sensor
>    - Humidity sensors

Basically, the Sense HAT is a board that has integrated sensors and a joystick, with an additional 8x8 LED matrix. It is a very fun board to play with and I recommend it if you don't want (or know, for that matter) to get tangled in wires and in calculating resistances.

Assembling the two boards
--------------------------
In order to get started, firstly we need to assemble the HAT on the Pi.

After carefully assembling the two boards (watching not to bend the pins of either boards) and putting the screws and the hexagonal stand-offs in place, you are ready to go. If successful, the end result should look similar to this:

Next Steps
----------

Next, we will use the Raspberry Pi with the Sense HAT to create cloud connected applications using C# and Python.
