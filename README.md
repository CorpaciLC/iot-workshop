=====================


About
-----

The goal of this workshop is to get people working with the IoT services from Microsoft Azure and to see how to integrate them with various operating systems and programming languages. 

The sessions presented will consist of a demo, accompanied by a step-by-step tutorial both on Windows + Visual Studio + C# + Windows IoT Core (on a Raspberry Pi 3) and Mac/Ubuntu + Python + Raspbian (on a Raspberry Pi 3).

For the duration of the workshop, we will provide Raspberry Pi 3 boards with Windows 10 IoT Core installed, but you can come with your own board or with Raspbian on a MicroSD card.
